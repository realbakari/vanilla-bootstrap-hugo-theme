### Capitalisation

There are lots of times when you need to use capital letters – for example, to start a sentence or for the pronoun _I_. Here are some other important rules for using them.

#### Days, months and holidays

We capitalize days of the week, months and festivals, but not seasons.

> _His birthday party is on Thursday.  
> Schools are closed at Christmas.  
> It rains a lot in April and May, but the summer is very dry._

#### Names of people and places

We capitalise the names of people and places, including streets, planets, continents, and countries.

> _Bea Jankowski has lived on Church Street in Manchester for 20 years.  
> The Earth is the third planet from the Sun.  
> Russia is in both Europe and Asia._

Words that come from the names of places – for example, languages, nationalities, and adjectives that refer to people or things from a country, region or city – are capitalized. We also capitalize nouns and adjectives that come from the names of religions.

> _Some Canadians speak French.  
> Londoners eat a lot of Indian food.  
> Most Muslims fast during the day for Ramadan._

#### Titles and names of institutions

The names of organisations and usually the important words in book and film titles are capitalised. When a person's job title goes before their name, capitalise both. If the title is separate from their name, capitalise only their name.

> _Salome Zourabichvili, the president of Georgia, is visiting President Alvi tomorrow.  
> The chief executive officer lives in New York.  
> We are reading_ War and Peace _with Ms Ioana, our teacher._

### Apostrophes

We use an apostrophe to show a contraction or possession.

#### Contractions

We use an apostrophe to show where there are missing letters in contractions.

> _It's raining._ (It's = It is)  
> _Don't worry, it won't rain._ (Don't = Do not; won't = will not)  
> _She can't drive because she's broken her leg._ (can't = cannot; she's = she has)  
> _I'd like a coffee, please._ (I'd = I would)  
> _You'll be fine._ (You'll = You will)

\** Note that **_it's_** is a contraction of _it is_ or _it has_. **_its_** is a possessive form of the pronoun _it_.

> _The dog is chasing its tail.  
> Are you sure it's OK for me to ring you so early?  
> It's rained a lot this week._

#### Possession

We also use an apostrophe with the letter _s_ after a noun (normally a person, animal or group) to show that the noun owns someone or something.

> _My cat's favourite toy is a small, red ball.  
> Sadiq's parents live in Liverpool._  
> _South Korea's economy is growing._

##### _Singular or plural_

We use _'s_ when the possessor is singular.

> _Marie's mother is going to Hong Kong._

We also use _'s_ when the possessor is a plural noun that does not end in _s_.

> _The People's Republic of China  
> My cousin writes children's books._

When a plural noun ends in _s_, we put the apostrophe after the _s_ (_s'_).

> _This is a picture of my parents' house.  
> Our friend's new car is red. She just got it yesterday.  
> Our friends' new car is red. They just got it yesterday._

When a singular noun ends in _s_, we generally use _'s_.

> _James's brother-in-law is German.  
> He has a collection of Dickens's novels._
