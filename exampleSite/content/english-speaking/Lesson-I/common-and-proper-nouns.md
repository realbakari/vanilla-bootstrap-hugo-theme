**Definition:** **Common nouns** name any person, place, thing, or idea. They are not capitalized unless they come at the beginning of a sentence. **Proper nouns** are the names of specific people, places, things, or ideas. Proper nouns should always be capitalized.

| Common |  | Proper |
| --- | --- | --- |
| boy | ⇒ | Gabin |
| river | ⇒ | Ruzizi River |
| car | ⇒ | Ford |
| doctor | ⇒ | Doctor Jefferson |
| town | ⇒ | Bujumbura |
| candy bar | ⇒ | Baby Ruth |

**Hint:**Don't forget to capitalize all parts of proper nouns. Many people forget to capitalize words like _river_ and _county_ in proper nouns like _Yellow River_ and _Orange County_.
