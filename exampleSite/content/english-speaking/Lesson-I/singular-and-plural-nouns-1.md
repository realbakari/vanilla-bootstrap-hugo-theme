**Definition:** **Singular** means only one. **Plural** means more than one.

In order to make a noun plural, it is usually only necessary to add **_s_**. However, there are many irregular nouns that add **_es_**. The rules for spelling plural nouns are based on the letters at the end of the word. The chart below breaks up the rules into categories so that they are easier to remember.

| Rule | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Most nouns | Add s to form the plural. | cat ⇒ cats   truck ⇒ trucks  bug ⇒ bugs |
| Nouns that end in s, sh, x, ch, or z | Add es to form the plural. For words that end in z, add an extra z before the es.Hint:It is too hard to pronounce the words without the e. Try it – buss, brushs, foxs... You sound like a snake! | bus ⇒ buses  brush ⇒ brushes fox ⇒ foxes   beach ⇒ beaches   quiz ⇒ quizzes |
| Nouns ending in f or fe | Some nouns ending in f or fe just add s. Sometimes it is necessary to change the f to a v. In that case, always end the word with es.Hint:Check a dictionary if you are unsure which rule a noun follows. | roof ⇒ roofs  safe ⇒ safes  shelf ⇒ shelves wife ⇒ wives |
