There are several different ways to compare things in English. We can also modify comparisons to show big or small differences.

### **Comparing**

We can use comparative adjectives to compare different things.

> _Max is taller than Judy.  
> You're more patient than I am.  
> His first book is less interesting than his second._

We can use _as … as_ with an adjective to say that two things are the same, or _not as … as_ to say that one thing is less than another.

> _Her hair is as long as mine.  
> It's not as sunny as yesterday._

We can also use expressions like _different from_, _similar to_ and _the same as_.

> _England is different from the United Kingdom.  
> His car is similar to mine.  
> The results from the first test are the same as the results from the second._

### **Showing big differences**

We can use _much_, _so much_, _a lot_, _even_ or _far_ with comparative adjectives.

> _Sales in July were a lot higher than sales in June.  
> He was far less experienced than the other applicant._

We can use _nowhere near_ with _as … as_.

> _The interview was nowhere near as difficult as the written exam._

We can use _very_, _really_, _completely_ or _totally_ with _different from_.

> _They may be twins, but they're completely different from each other._

### **Showing small differences**

We can use _slightly_, _a little_, _a bit_, _a little bit_ or _not much_ with comparative adjectives.

> _The number of registrations has been slightly lower than we expected.  
> Houses in my city are not much more expensive than flats._

We can use _almost_, _nearly_, _not quite_, _roughly_, _more or less_ or _about_ with _as … as_ and _the same as_.

> _She's almost as old as I am.  
> The figures for May are more or less the same as the figures for June._

We can use _very_ or _really_ with _similar to_.

> _My son looks really similar to my father when he was that age._

### **Showing there is no difference**

We can use _exactly the same as_ or _just as … as_ to emphasise that there is no difference.

> _My grandma's cakes still taste exactly the same as when I was a child!  
> A new phone can be just as expensive as a new computer these days._
