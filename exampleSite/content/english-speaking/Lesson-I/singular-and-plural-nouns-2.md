In this lesson, you will learn the rest of the rules for spelling plural nouns.

| Rule | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Nouns that end in vowel + y | Add s to form the plural. |
| Nouns that end in vowel + o | Add s to form the plural. |
| Nouns that end in consonant + y | Change the y to i and add es to form the plural. |
| Nouns that end in consonant + o | Easy rule:Usually add es except for musical terms.Complicated rule:Some nouns that end in consonant + o add es. Many can be spelled either way. Look in the dictionary if you want to be sure.These nouns always add es: potato, tomato, hero, echo, banjo, embargo, veto, torpedo.Here are the preferred spellings of some plural nouns: buffaloes, dominoes, mosquitoes, volcanoes, tornadoes, ghettos, mangos, mottos, cargos, halos, mementos. |

The chart below explains some exceptions to the rules.

| Exceptions | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Words from foreign languages, including musical terms | Simply add s. |
| Words that are proper nouns | Simply add s. |
| Words that are short forms of longer words | Simply add s. |
| Hint: If a musical term or proper noun ends in s still add es. | chorus ⇒ chorusesJones ⇒ Joneses |

**Hint:** Are you confused yet? The easiest way to handle the plural nouns in this lesson is to remember a few shortcuts:

* Memorize the shortlist of words that must end in **_es_**.
* Add **_es_** to words that end in **_consonant_** + **_o_**.
* For words that end in **_consonant_** + **_y_**, change **_y_** to **_i_** and add **_es_**.
* Remember that foreign words usually end in **_s_**, not **_es_**.
