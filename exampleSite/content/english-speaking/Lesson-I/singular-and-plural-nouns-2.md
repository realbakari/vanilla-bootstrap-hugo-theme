**Hint:** Are you confused yet? The easiest way to handle the plural nouns in this lesson is to remember a few shortcuts:

* Memorize the shortlist of words that must end in **_es_**.
* Add **_es_** to words that end in **_consonant_** + **_o_**.
* For words that end in **_consonant_** + **_y_**, change **_y_** to **_i_** and add **_es_**.
* Remember that foreign words usually end in **_s_**, not **_es_**.
