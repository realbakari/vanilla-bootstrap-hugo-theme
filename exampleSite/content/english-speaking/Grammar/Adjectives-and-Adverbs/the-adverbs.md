The adverbs and the adjectives in English

**Adjectives** tell us **_something about a person or a thing_**. Adjectives can modify nouns _(here: girl)_ or pronouns _(here: she)_.

**Adverbs** tell us **_in what way someone does something_**. Adverbs can modify verbs _(here: drive)_, adjectives or other adverbs.

Adjective			       Adverb

Mandy is a **careful** girl.	Mandy **drives** carefully.

**She** is very _careful_.		She **drives** carefully.

Mandy is a **careful** **_driver_**. This sentence is about Mandy, the driver, so use the **_adjective_**.

Mandy **drives** **_carefully_**. This sentence is about her way of driving, so use the **_adverb_**.

### Form

Adjective + -**ly**

Adjective	       Adverb

dangerous	dangerous**ly**

careful		careful**ly**

nice		        nice**ly**

horrible	        horrib**ly**

easy		        easi**ly**

electronic	electronical**ly**

Irregular forms:

Adjective	      Adverb

good		well

fast		        fast

hard		        hard

If the adjective ends in _-y_, change _-y_ to _-i_. Then add _-ly_:

* happ**y** – happ**ily**

but:

* sh**y** – sh**yly**

If the adjective ends in _-le_, the adverb ends in _-ly_:

* terrib**le** – terrib**ly**

If the adjective ends in _-e_, then add _-ly_:

* saf**e** – saf**ely**

► Not all words ending in _-ly_ are adverbs:

* **adjectives ending in _-ly_:** friendly, silly, lonely, ugly
* **nouns, ending in _-ly_:** ally, bully, Italy, melancholy
* **verbs, ending in _-ly_:** apply, rely, supply

There is no adverb for an adjective ending in _-ly_.

## Use of adverbs

### To modify verbs

The handball team **played** **badly** last Saturday.

### To modify adjectives

It was an **extremely** **bad** match.

### To modify adverbs

The handball team played **extremely** **badly** last Wednesday.

### To modify quantities

There are **quite** **a lot of** people here.

### To modify sentences

**Unfortunately**, the flight to Dallas had been canceled**.**

### Types of adverbs

#### Adverbs of manner

* **quickly**
* **kindly**

#### Adverbs of degree

* **very**
* **rather**

#### Adverbs of frequency

* **often**
* **sometimes**

#### Adverbs of time

* **now**
* **today**

#### Adverbs of place

* **here**
* **nowhere**

### How do know whether to use an adjective or an adverb?

John is a **careful** **driver**. – In this sentence, we say how John is – **careful**. If we want to say that the careful John did not drive the usual way yesterday – we have to use the **adverb**:

* John **did not drive** **carefully** yesterday.

Here is another example:

* I am a **slow** walker. _(How am I? → **slow** → **adjective**)_
* I walk **slowly**. _(How do I walk? → **slowly** → **adverb**)_

Adjective or Adverb after special verbs

Both adjectives and adverbs may be used after look, smell, and taste. Mind the change in meaning.

Here are two examples:

Adjective		               Adverb

The pizza tastes **good**.	   Jamie Oliver can taste **well**.

(_How is the pizza?_)	           (_How can Jamie Oliver taste?_)

Peter's feet smell **bad**.	   Peter can smell **badly**.

(_How are his feet?_)	           (_How can Peter smell?_)

Do not get confused with _good/well_.

* Linda looks **good**. _(What type of person is she?)_
* Linda looks **well**. _(How is Linda? – She may have been ill, but now she is fit again.)_
* How are you? – I'm fine, thank you.**![](https://www.englisch-hilfen.de/img/svg/be.svg "British English")**/I'm good.**![](https://www.englisch-hilfen.de/img/svg/ae.svg "American English")** (emotional state)
* How are you? – I'm **well**, thank you. (physical state)

One can assume that in the second/third sentence the adverb **well** is used, but this is wrong – **well** can be an **adjective** (meaning fit/healthy), or an **adverb** of the adjective good.

### Conclusion:

* Use the **adjective** when you say something about the **person** itself.
* Use the **adverb**, when you want to say about the **action**.
