### What are adjectives?

**Adjectives** tell us **something about a person or a thing**.

### What do adjectives modify?

**Adjectives** can modify **nouns** or **pronouns/names**.

|🧑 Person		|	 🚘 Thing|
|---|---|
|Mandy is a careful girl.	|This is a **nice** _car_.|
|**Mandy** is _careful_.	|	_The car_ is **nice**.|
|**She** is _careful_.		|	_It_ is **nice**.|

### Where do adjectives go?

An **adjective** can be put **before** **the noun**. Then it is an attribute.

|🧑 Person		|	🚘 Thing|
|---|---|
|Mandy is a **careful** _girl_.	|This is a **nice** _car_.|

An **adjective** can be put **after** the **verb to be _(is)_**. This is called a predicative position.

|🧑 Person	|	🚘 Thing|
|---|---|
|The girl _is_ **careful**.|	This car _is_ **nice**.|

Adjectives can go after the following verbs:

* **appear**
* **become**
* **feel**
* **get**
* **go**
* **keep**
* **turn**

When we speak about what something **looks** like, **smells**, **sounds,** and **tastes** – we use the adjective. Mind the difference between adjectives and adverbs.

* I **_feel _great**.
* She **_looks _good**.
* It **_seems _impossible**.
* The steak **_smells _fantastic**.

### Can adjectives be used without nouns?

Yes, adjectives can be used without **nouns**. Mind the definite article _the_:

* the **rich** = **rich** **people**

Here is an example from the fairy tale _Cinderella_:

* _“The **good** must be put in the dish, the **bad** you may eat if you wish.”_

Here is another example with nationalities in the plural:

* The **Scottish** live in the North of the United Kingdom.

### Adjectives, ending in _-ing and -ed_

Here are some examples:

#### Here the **adjective** is put **before** the **noun**:

* Yesterday I read an **amusing** **_story _**in a magazine.
* Doris has a **boring** **_job_**.
* We watched the group of **excited** **_people_**.

#### Here the **adjective** is put **after** the **verb**:

* I **_was _**not at all **amused** by the discussion.
* Children **_get _bored** very quickly.
* The end of the film **_was _**really **exciting** for me.
