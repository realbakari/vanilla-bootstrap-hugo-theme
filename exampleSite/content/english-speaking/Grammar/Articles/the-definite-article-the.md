The definite article – _the_

The definite article **_the_ is the same for all genders in singular and in the plural**.

* _the_ boy
* _the_ girl
* _the_ cat
* _the_ computers

If the following word begins with a **consonant**, we speak \[ðə\], if the following word begins with a **vowel**, we speak \[ði:\].

| \[ðə\] | \[ði:\] |
| --- | --- |
| the following word starts with a spoken consonantthe girlthe bookthe school | the following word starts with a spoken vowelthe English girlthe orange bookthe old school |
| Compare the following words: |
| Here \[j\] is pronounced at the beginning of the word → the unit | Here \[ʌ\] is pronounced at the beginning of the word → the uncle |

We have listed some examples in the following table. There you can see when we use the definite article and when we don't.

We use the seasons of the year _(spring, summer, autumn, winter)_ with or without the definite article.

* in summer
* in _the_ summer

The American English word _fall_ is **always** used with the definite article **_the_**.

***

Sometimes we use the article and sometimes we do not. It often depends on the context. Watch the following example:

1. The student goes to school.
2. The mother is going to **_the_** school.

In the first sentence, we do not use the definite article, in the second we do. The student goes to school for its primary purpose, so we **do not use the article**.

The mother might talk to a teacher, for example. She visits the school for a different reason. That's why we use the definite article **_the_** in the second sentence.
