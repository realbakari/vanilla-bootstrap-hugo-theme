If you want to _quickly_ achieve fluency level - to speak English easily, fluently and automatically, you'll need to do the following:

**Learn through repetition.**

Meaning, you will need to listen to every example sentence many, many times until you MASTER it. Don't listen just one time or a few times. It's not enough. You will forget it very soon.

You may know how to use a word to make a correct sentence, but here's the thing: _Can you use it quickly, easily, and automatically?_

If the answer is no, you need to repeat more. You must listen to that example sentence again and again.

_Don't_ ignore this simple secret. This is how you will achieve automatically fast speaking.
