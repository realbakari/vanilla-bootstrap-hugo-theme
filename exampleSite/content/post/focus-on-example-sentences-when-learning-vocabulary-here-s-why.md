+++
When it comes to learning English vocabulary, **the most important thing** **you need to focus on is** **example sentences** because they help you to improve _all_ your English skills - including vocabulary, listening, speaking, and writing.

* _Vocabulary_: Example sentences help you **understand the meaning of the word correctly**, and **remember it deeply**. Why? Because you see the word in _context_.
* _Speaking/Writing_: You will **learn how to use a word in sentences** — how to connect it with other words to produce correct English sentences. For each sentence you hear or read, you will be able to **re-use it (or part of it) to produce your own correct sentence**.
* _Grammar_: You **learn English grammar naturally**. You don’t have to _think_ about grammar rules to produce a sentence. Phrases and sentences just appear naturally in your mind and they are all correct. You “feel" grammar, just like a native English speaker.
