+++
A verb is an action, existence, or occurrence. In the simple sentences we used so far, the verb is mostly in the existing form. They are "am", "is", and "are".  
  
Other types of verbs are action verbs such as:  
  
Wash  
Run  
Walk  
Throw  
Jump  
Dance  
Laugh  
Learn  
Teach  
  
There are many action verbs, but I only listed a few to let you know what I am referring to. Here are some sentences to help you understand.  
  
"I need to wash my face"  
"John **taught** Gabin"  
"Bakari is **laughing**"  
  
A verb can also start at the beginning of the sentence.  
  
"**Throw** the ball at the catcher"  
"**Run** towards the finish line"  
  
It is important to understand the verb, but having just a subject and a verb is not sufficient. For example, "Jill run" is not a complete sentence. Although Jill can be the subject, and "run" is the verb, this is not a complete sentence. That is why the previous lesson on predicate is important. With the predicate, we can turn the sentence into a proper sentence. "Gabin is running"
